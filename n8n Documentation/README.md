## Creating Workflows

Once n8n is up and running, you can begin creating your workflows.

### Nodes

Workflows in n8n consist of nodes. Each node performs a specific action, such as sending an HTTP request, querying a database, or manipulating data.

### Triggers

Triggers are special nodes that start a workflow when an event occurs. For example:
- **Webhook trigger**: Start the workflow when a webhook is received.
- **Cron trigger**: Execute the workflow on a scheduled time.

### Integrations

n8n supports integrations with more than 200 services and APIs. Some popular integrations include:
- Slack
- GitHub
- Google Sheets
- Airtable
- MySQL/PostgreSQL

You can easily combine different integrations in a workflow to automate processes across various platforms.

---

## Using the API

n8n also provides an API to interact with workflows programmatically. You can trigger workflows, retrieve data, or control the workflow execution with REST API endpoints.

Example API usage:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5678/api/v1/workflows/execute
```

API documentation is available to guide you in integrating n8n with external systems.

---

## Self-hosting

n8n can be self-hosted for those who prefer full control over their workflows and data. Self-hosting allows you to:
- Ensure data privacy
- Customize environment settings
- Scale the infrastructure based on your needs

### Self-hosting options

- **Docker**: Easily deploy and manage n8n with Docker.
- **Cloud providers**: Host n8n on platforms such as AWS, DigitalOcean, or Azure.
