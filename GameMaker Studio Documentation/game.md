## **3. Implementation of GameMaker Studio**

### **3.1. Setting Up the Project**

#### **Step 1: Installation & Setup**
- **Download**: Visit the official YoYo Games website to download the latest version of GameMaker Studio. The installation process is straightforward and user-friendly.
- **Account Creation**: Create or log into your YoYo Games account, which is necessary for licensing, updates, and accessing community features, such as the Marketplace.

#### **Step 2: Creating a New Project**
- **Project Templates**: Upon creating a new project, developers can choose from various templates, including empty projects or pre-configured templates for specific game genres, such as platformers or puzzle games.
- **Project Organization**: Setting up a clear project structure is vital for maintaining organization. Organize folders for sprites, sounds, scripts, backgrounds, and objects to facilitate easy navigation and development.

#### **Step 3: Organizing Assets**
- **Asset Importing**: Use the asset manager to import resources like images, audio files, and fonts into your project. This feature supports multiple file formats, ensuring versatility in asset creation.
- **Built-in Editors**: GameMaker provides built-in editors for modifying sprites and sounds, allowing for quick adjustments without needing to switch between external tools.

### **3.2. Object-Oriented Design**

GameMaker Studio adopts an object-oriented approach to game development, where game entities are represented as **Objects**.

#### **Step 1: Defining Objects**
- **Object Properties**: Each object can have properties such as position, size, and collision masks. Developers can customize these properties to suit the gameplay mechanics they want to implement.
- **Types of Objects**: Common object types include player characters, enemies, items, and environmental elements, each serving a unique function within the game.

#### **Step 2: Adding Events**
- **Event-Driven Programming**: Objects can respond to various events such as keyboard input, mouse clicks, and collisions. This modular approach allows for clean code organization and easier debugging.
- **Common Events**:
  - **Create Event**: This event initializes properties when an object is created. For example, setting the player's initial health or speed can be defined here.
  - **Step Event**: This event executes code continuously every frame, making it ideal for handling character movement and real-time updates.
  - **Collision Event**: This event triggers actions when one object collides with another, allowing developers to define interactions between game elements, such as damage calculation or item collection.

#### **Step 3: Adding Actions or Code**
- **Drag-and-Drop vs. GML**: Developers can choose to use drag-and-drop actions to add functionality or write custom code in GML for more precise control over game behavior. This flexibility accommodates both visual and code-based development styles.
- **Example Code for Player Movement**:

```gml
if keyboard_check(vk_right)
{
    x += 4; // Move right
}
if keyboard_check(vk_left)
{
    x -= 4; // Move left
}
if keyboard_check(vk_space) && place_meeting(x, y + 1, obj_ground)
{
    vspeed = -10; // Jump
}
```

### **3.3. Room Setup**

**Rooms** serve as the game’s environment or levels where all the action takes place.

#### **Step 1: Creating a Room**
- **Room Editor**: Use the room editor to design levels by placing objects, backgrounds, and tiles within the game space. The room editor provides a grid-based interface for precise object placement.
- **Room Properties**: Configure room settings such as dimensions, speed (which affects game frame rate), and views (camera settings), allowing developers to control the gameplay experience.

#### **Step 2: Setting Room Properties**
- **Background Layers**: Add multiple background layers for parallax scrolling effects, which enhance the visual depth of the game. This technique creates an immersive environment that engages players.
- **Tile Management**: Utilize tilesets to create complex environments without placing each object individually, which significantly speeds up level design and enhances consistency across levels.

```gml
var playerScore = 0; // Declare a score variable
```

### **4.2. Data Structures**
- **Built-in Structures**: GML supports various data structures, including arrays, lists, and maps, which allow for efficient data management and manipulation. These structures enable developers to handle complex data sets effectively.
- **Example of Creating and Using a List**:

```gml
var myList = ds_list_create(); // Create a new list
ds_list_add(myList, "Item 1"); // Add items to the list
```

### **4.3. Debugging & Breakpoints**
- **Debugging Tools**: GMS provides integrated debugging tools that allow developers to track variable values, set breakpoints, and

 step through code execution to identify issues efficiently.
- **Error Reporting**: GML offers detailed error messages, helping developers quickly locate and resolve problems in their code.
