## Introduction

Structured Query Language (SQL) is a powerful language used to interact with relational databases. From simple data retrieval to complex data manipulation, SQL provides a range of tools to manage and control data efficiently. This documentation outlines the key concepts, commands, functions, and best practices to help you understand and work with SQL effectively.

## What is SQL?

SQL, or **Structured Query Language**, is a standard programming language designed for managing and manipulating relational databases. It allows for a wide range of operations, including querying data, updating records, and defining database structures. SQL is essential for data professionals, developers, and database administrators to work with data efficiently.

---

## Key SQL Concepts

1. **Tables**: Tables store data in rows and columns.
2. **Schemas**: A logical structure defining the organization of data in a database.
3. **Keys**: 
    - **Primary Key**: Uniquely identifies each record.
    - **Foreign Key**: A field that links two tables together.
4. **Indexes**: Improve data retrieval speed by creating data pointers.
5. **Constraints**: Ensure data integrity by restricting the values that can be stored in a table.

---

## Basic SQL Commands

### SELECT
Used to query data from a table.

```sql
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```

### INSERT
Adds new records into a table.

```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2) VALUES (value1, value2);
```

### UPDATE
Modifies existing records in a table.

```sql
UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1 WHERE condition;
```

### DELETE
Deletes records from a table.

```sql
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```

---

## Data Definition Language (DDL)

### CREATE
Creates a new table or other database objects.

```sql
CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column1 datatype,
    column2 datatype
);
```

### ALTER
Modifies an existing object.

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name ADD column_name datatype;
```

### DROP
Removes a database object.

```sql
DROP TABLE table_name;
```

---

## Data Manipulation Language (DML)

DML commands allow manipulation of the data within tables.

- **SELECT**: Retrieves data.
- **INSERT**: Adds new data.
- **UPDATE**: Modifies data.
- **DELETE**: Removes data.

---

## Data Control Language (DCL)

### GRANT
Provides user access to database objects.

```sql
GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON table_name TO user;
```

### REVOKE
Removes user access.

```sql
REVOKE SELECT, INSERT ON table_name FROM user;
```

---

## SQL Constraints

### Primary Key
Uniquely identifies each record.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(50)
);
```

### Foreign Key
Links two tables together.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Orders (
    OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    CustomerID INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES Customers(CustomerID)
);
```

### Unique
Ensures that values in a column are unique.

```sql
ALTER TABLE Employees ADD CONSTRAINT UC_Employee UNIQUE (Email);
```

### Check
Ensures that a condition is met before inserting a value.

```sql
ALTER TABLE Employees ADD CONSTRAINT CHK_Age CHECK (Age >= 18);
```

---

## SQL Functions

### Aggregate Functions
- **COUNT()**: Returns the number of rows.
- **SUM()**: Returns the sum of a column.
- **AVG()**: Returns the average value.

### String Functions
- **CONCAT()**: Combines two or more strings.
- **UPPER()**: Converts a string to uppercase.
- **LOWER()**: Converts a string to lowercase.

### Date Functions
- **CURRENT_DATE()**: Returns the current date.
- **DATEDIFF()**: Returns the difference between two dates.

---

## Normalization

Normalization is the process of structuring a relational database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. It typically involves breaking down larger tables into smaller, related tables and using keys to establish relationships.

---

## SQL Joins

Joins combine rows from two or more tables:

- **INNER JOIN**: Returns records with matching values in both tables.
- **LEFT JOIN**: Returns all records from the left table and matching records from the right table.
- **RIGHT JOIN**: Returns all records from the right table and matching records from the left table.
- **FULL JOIN**: Returns all records when thereâ€™s a match in either table.

```sql
SELECT columns FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.id = table2.id;
```

---

## Subqueries and Nested Queries

Subqueries are queries inside other queries to further refine results.

```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Salary > (SELECT AVG(Salary) FROM Employees);
```

---

## Transactions and ACID Properties

**Transactions** ensure that SQL operations either fully complete or fully fail, maintaining data integrity. ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) are properties that ensure reliable transaction processing.

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
UPDATE Accounts SET Balance = Balance - 100 WHERE AccountID = 1;
UPDATE Accounts SET Balance = Balance + 100 WHERE AccountID = 2;
COMMIT;
```

---

## Views in SQL

Views are virtual tables created from SQL queries.

```sql
CREATE VIEW EmployeeView AS SELECT Name, Department FROM Employees;
```

---

## Stored Procedures and Functions

### Stored Procedure
Reusable SQL code stored in the database.

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployees AS SELECT * FROM Employees;
```

### Function
Returns a single value from a SQL query.

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION GetEmployeeCount() RETURNS INT AS
RETURN (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Employees);
```

---

## Indexes

Indexes improve the speed of data retrieval by creating fast access paths to data.

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_employee_name ON Employees (Name);
```

---

## Best Practices

1. **Use Proper Indexing**: Ensure important columns are indexed for performance.
2. **Avoid SELECT ***: Retrieve only required columns.
3. **Normalize Data**: Minimize redundancy.
4. **Use Prepared Statements**: Protect against SQL injection.
5. **Backup Regularly**: Ensure data is backed up consistently.

---

## Advanced Topics

### Window Functions
Perform calculations across a set of table rows related to the current row.

```sql
SELECT Name, Salary, RANK() OVER (ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS Rank FROM Employees;
```

### Common Table Expressions (CTE)
Temporary result sets used within a query.

```sql
WITH EmployeeCTE AS (SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Salary > 5000)
SELECT * FROM EmployeeCTE;
```

### Partitioning
Dividing a large table into smaller, manageable pieces.

This SQL documentation provides a comprehensive guide, from basic commands to advanced techniques, for managing relational databases. Whether you're querying data or optimizing database performance, SQL offers powerful tools for efficient data management.
