## Creating AI Workflows

Once Flowise is up and running, you can start building AI workflows using the visual interface.

### Nodes

Workflows in Flowise are created by connecting nodes. Each node represents a task or action, such as data input, AI model execution, or external service integration.

### Triggers

Triggers initiate workflows based on external events. You can configure triggers like:
- **HTTP trigger**: Start workflows via an HTTP request.
- **Webhook trigger**: Start workflows when a webhook event is received.
- **Scheduled trigger**: Run workflows at scheduled intervals.

### Integrations

Flowise integrates with multiple external services, enabling users to build robust AI-powered applications that connect to:
- Databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)
- APIs
- SaaS platforms (e.g., Google Cloud, AWS, OpenAI)

---

## API Usage

Flowise also provides an API to control workflows and automate processes programmatically. The API enables you to trigger workflows, retrieve data, and monitor their execution via HTTP endpoints.

### Example API Request

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/workflows/execute
```

Refer to the [API documentation](https://docs.flowise.com/api) for detailed instructions on how to interact with Flowise programmatically.

---

## Self-hosting

Flowise can be self-hosted on your infrastructure, offering complete control over your environment and data privacy. Self-hosting enables you to:
- Ensure data security
- Customize configurations and environment variables
- Scale the application to meet performance needs

### Self-hosting options

- **Docker**: Deploy Flowise on Docker for easy containerized hosting.
- **Cloud platforms**: Host Flowise on cloud providers like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure.

Check out the [self-hosting documentation](https://docs.flowise.com/self-hosting) for more information.
